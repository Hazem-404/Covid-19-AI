# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Covid-19 data by country**, including:
- Training machine learning models on Covid-19 datasets.
- Evaluating models using metrics such as **accuracy score**.
- Running multiple experiments (100 runs) to compute **min, max, and average scores**.
- Visualizing Covid-19 deaths across countries with clear and simple plots.

The goal is to understand the dataset better and build reproducible experiments for data analysis.
